    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A very light and fluffy pancake recipe that requires fresh buttermilk, but it's the best I've ever made!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>3 cups</b> all-purpose flour</li>
        <li><b>3 tablespoons</b> white sugar</li>
        <li><b>3 teaspoons</b> baking powder</li>
        <li><b>1 1/2 teaspoons</b> baking soda</li>
        <li><b>3/4 teaspoon</b> salt</li>
        <li><b>3 cups</b> buttermilk</li>
        <li><b>1/2 cup</b> milk</li>
        <li><b>3</b> large eggs</li>
        <li><b>1/3 cup</b> melted butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Beat buttermilk, milk, eggs, and
            melted butter together in a separate bowl. Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. You can flick water across the surface and
            if it beads up and sizzles, it's ready.
        </li>
        <li>Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture; use a wooden spoon or fork to mix until it's just blended
            together. The batter will be a little lumpy which is what you want.</li>
        <li>Pour or scoop batter onto the preheated griddle, using approximately 1/2 cup for each pancake. Cook until
            bubbles appear on the surface, 1 to 2 minutes; flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side.
            Repeat with remaining batter</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
