    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>For the Crust:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>250g</b> digestive biscuits</li>
        <li><b>125g</b> butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Filling:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>750g</b> fresh cheese</li>
        <li><b>170g</b> fresh cream</li>
        <li><b>80g</b> white sugar</li>
        <li><b>1/2</b> vanilla pod</li>
        <li><b>8g</b> gelatine sheets</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Coating:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>250g</b> raspberry jam</li>
        <li><b>Few drops</b> of lemon juice</li>
        <li><b>1/2 glass</b> of water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start preparing the no-bake cheesecake from the base: finely crush the biscuits using a food processor,
            place them in a bowl, and mix them with the melted butter. Alternatively, you can crush them using a meat
            tenderizer after sealing them in a food-safe bag. Spread the mixture evenly over the bottom of a 22 cm
            (8.5-inch) springform pan, pressing it down well with the back of a spoon. Place in the refrigerator until
            it's time to assemble the cake.</li>
        <li>Soak the gelatin in cold water for about 10 minutes. In a bowl, whip the cream cheese with the sugar, 150 g
            of cream, and the vanilla seeds extracted from the pod until you get a smooth mixture. Place the remaining
            cream in a saucepan and heat it. Add the well-drained gelatin and stir until it has completely dissolved.
        </li>
        <li>Let the mixture cool down, then add it to the cream cheese mixture, mixing well. Pour everything over the
            biscuit base, level it out, and place in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours. After this time, heat the
            raspberry jam in a small saucepan with the water and lemon juice. Let it cool slightly, then spread it over
            the surface of the cake. Place back in the refrigerator for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Then, remove the cheesecake from the pan and serve.</li>
    </ol>
